#1 Declare the variable called age, and initialize it
#with your own age - then, print the result
age = 19
print(age)

#2 Declare the variable called name, and initialize it
#with you own first and last name - then, print the result
name = "Noah Wilkie"
print(name)


#3 Write a decision statement comparing the variable called - answer -
#with 'yes', that ONLY tests for a TRUE answer (ie no else statement)
answer = input("Are you alive? : ")
if answer == "yes" :
    print("Congratulations!!")

#4 Using the same decision statement as above, add an else statement
answer = input("Are you alive? : ")
if answer == "yes" :
    print("Congratulations!!")
else:
    print("How did you respond to the question???")
